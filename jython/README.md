# INSTALLATION
1. Compile the ABAGAIL using ant
2. Install jython before you run the script

# USAGE
```bash
$ ./run.sh <whatever_name_you_want_to_give_your_trial>
```

After that you can find the logs inside logs/&lt;thenameyoujustgave&gt;/

Don't run the `.py` scripts unless you take care of the `CLASSPATH` beforehand.

Look at `harproblem.py` and `plot.py` to see how things are implemented.
